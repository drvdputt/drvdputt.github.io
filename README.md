# My "Github Pages" website

This website should be automatically built as long has the following is set up:
- The name of this repository needs to be exactly username.github.io
- The github pages setting needs to be enabled. Click the ‘Settings’ button on
  the repository home page. Then scroll down to the bottom where you see ‘GitHub
  Pages’ section and choose the master branch for the source.

This website was made using the HTML5up "Dimension" template. Edits to
index.html should be straightforward, since it's well documented with comments.
The website's mechanics are all in assets/css/main.css. Index.html references
many definitions from this file. So if I ever want to change the design of the
website, I should replace both the assets and the index.html structure by
something from a new template. After that, I should copy-paste everything from
the old website into the right places of index.html.
