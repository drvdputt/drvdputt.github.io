		<h2>PDRs4All: XVI. Tracing aromatic infrared band characteristics in photodissociation region spectra with PAHFIT in the JWST era</h2>
		<p>Context. Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit strong
                emission bands between 3–20 μm known as the aromatic infrared
                bands (AIBs), and they originate from small carbonaceous species
                such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) excited by UV
                radiation. The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs are
                considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic
                star-forming regions. Recently, the PDRs4All JWST program
                observed the Orion Bar PDR, revealing the subcomponents and
                profile variations of the AIBs in very high detail. Aims. We
                present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition
                tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents,
                thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust
                extinction. We aim to provide a configuration that enables
                highly detailed decompositions of JWST spectra of PDRs (3.1–26
                μm) and to test if the same configuration is suitable to
                characterize AIB emission in extragalactic star forming regions.
                Methods. We determined the central wavelength and FWHM of the
                AIB subcomponents by fitting selected segments of the Orion Bar
                spectra and compiled them into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT. We
                tested the PDR pack by applying PAHFIT to the full 3.1–26 μm
                PDRs4All templates. We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the
                default continuum model to seven spectra extracted from the
                central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. Results. We
                introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar
                spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the
                intensity at 15–26 μm. Using the PDR pack and the alternate
                continuum model, PAHFIT reproduces the Orion Bar template
                spectra with residuals of a few percent. A similar performance
                is achieved when applying the PDR pack to the NGC7469 spectra.
                We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile
                variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 μm AIBs and thus
                the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 μm AIB
                emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more
                prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring
                more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small
                grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded
                environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on
                these new diagnostics, we show and quantify the strong
                similarity of the AIB profiles observed in NGC7469 to the Orion
                Bar template spectra.</p>

	      <h2>PDRs4All VIII: MIR emission line inventory of the Orion Bar</h2>
                <p> Mid-infrared emission features probe the properties of
                  ionized gas, and hot or warm molecular gas. The Orion Bar is a
                  frequently studied photodissociation region (PDR) containing
                  large amounts of gas under these conditions, and was observed
                  with the MIRI IFU aboard JWST as part of the "PDRs4All"
                  program. The resulting IR spectroscopic images of high angular
                  resolution (0.2") reveal a rich observational inventory of
                  mid-IR emission lines, and spatially resolve the substructure
                  of the PDR, with a mosaic cutting perpendicularly across the
                  ionization front and three dissociation fronts. We list around
                  100 lines in a table, and measured the line intensities and
                  central wavelengths. The H I recombination lines originating
                  from the ionized gas layer bordering the PDR. This includes H
                  I recombination lines, various ionization stages of Ne, P, S,
                  Cl, Ar, Fe, and Ni, and the pure-rotational H2 lines in the
                  vibrational ground state from 0-0 S(1) to 0-0 S(8), and in the
                  first vibrationally excited state from 1-1 S(5) to 1-1 S(9).
